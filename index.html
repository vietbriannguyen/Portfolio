<!-- Summary using <p> paragraph
    <p><center>Mechanical Design Engineer is my current job title, but I like to consider myself a lifelong learner within the field of engineering. On one hand, being able to design physical objects has always interested me and is what drew me to the world of mechanical engineering. On the other hand, as I grow older and see the trends within technology in today's world, I become more and more fascinated with the software side of engineering. Currently, I am striving to be a self taught developer seeking to understand the vast world of coding.</center>
